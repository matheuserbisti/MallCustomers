# Mall Customers

## Objective

This project aims to provide a Statistical Analysis about the customers in a specific mall.


## Justification

During a Father's Day sale on various stores inside a mall, the managers of said mall decided to collect data about their customers, aiming to gather more useful information that could lead to better marketing. 

Considering this problem, Professor Claudete Ruas proposed our group to find answers for 10 questions that the managers might have, and this is the main objective of this study.

However, please note that this project was made during our early college years, and was designed as a training project for Exploratory Analysis, Hypothesis Testing and Sampling. In this context, the study is rather basic compared to more advanced statistical techniques, lacking modeling and such. Still, it is well constructed in its proposal and objective, and worth delving into.


## Choices and Metodology

Since this is a "beginner-friendly" project, Professor Ruas kindly handed the data in perfect conditions, with no necessity of cleaning or transformation, other than removing missing values. The only data shaping process we did was a simple random sample of size 347 from the original dataset, as suggested by the Professor.

After that, we conducted a series of analyses through multiple plots and tests, with the purpose of extracting key information from the data, in order to answer 10 predetermined questions.

In the end, we were able to gather many insights through our study, which is present in the "Grupo8-Artur\_Matheus\_Ramon-TrabMet2.Rmd" file. Please note, the whole analysis is written in portuguese, and there are required files for knitting the PDF file, all of which need to be in the same directory as the .Rmd file.
